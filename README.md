Create a analyzer counting different metrics inside the *.c or *.h file, more in [documentation](https://github.com/dusekdan/IPP-Project/blob/master/CST/CST-doc.pdf).

##XTD
Create a parser that goes through XML data and transform those data into DDL (*data definition language*), which pretty much stands for SQL commands in one file. More in [documentation](https://github.com/dusekdan/IPP-Project/blob/master/XTD/XTD-doc.pdf).
